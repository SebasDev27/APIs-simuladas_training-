# APIs-simuladas_training
This project, **APIs-simuladas_training**, is designed to help developers practice and learn how to interact with simulated APIs in a controlled environment. It aims to provide a safe and flexible space for experimenting with API requests, responses, and integration patterns without the risks or limitations of using live services.

The main features of this project include:

- **Mock API Endpoints:** Offers a comprehensive set of endpoints that mimic real-world API behavior, supporting various HTTP methods and response types for testing and training purposes.
- **Authentication Simulation:** Includes examples of authentication flows such as token-based authentication, allowing users to understand and implement secure access patterns.
- **Error Handling:** Demonstrates common API error responses, such as 400, 401, and 500 status codes, to help users learn how to handle errors gracefully in their applications.
- **Data Simulation:** Returns realistic sample data for different endpoints, enabling both front-end and back-end developers to perform integration testing and UI prototyping.
- **Customizable Scenarios:** Allows users to modify or extend the mock endpoints and data, adapting the project to specific learning or testing needs.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Each endpoint is thoroughly documented, including request/response examples and usage notes, to facilitate understanding and ease of use.

This repository is ideal for developers, QA engineers, and students who want to improve their API integration skills, test error handling strategies, or prototype applications without relying on external services. By using **APIs-simuladas_training**, you can accelerate your development workflow and gain practical experience with modern API practices.
